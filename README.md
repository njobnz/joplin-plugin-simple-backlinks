Simple Backlinks is a plugin for Joplin that displays backlinks to the current note, either in the markdown viewer or a separate panel. Designed as a drop-in replacement for the [Automatic Backlinks](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/automatic-backlinks-with-manual-insert-option/13632) plugin, it provides lightweight backlink functionality. For a more advanced note-referencing system with additional features, consider the [Joplin Note Link System](https://github.com/ylc395/joplin-plugin-note-link-system) plugin.
